```

### 2.1 Functional Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components or functions
- **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between components
- **System Testing**: Testing the entire system as a whole
- **Acceptance Testing**: Verifying if the system meets business requirements

### 2.2 Non-Functional Testing
- **Performance Testing**: Evaluating system performance under various conditions
- **Security Testing**: Identifying vulnerabilities and security flaws
- **Usability Testing**: Assessing user-friendliness and user experience
- **Compatibility Testing**: Ensuring the system works across different environments

## 3. Test-Driven Development (TDD) 🔄

TDD is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code.

### 3.1 TDD Cycle:
1. Write a failing test
2. Write minimal code to pass the test
3. Refactor the code
4. Repeat

### 3.2 Benefits of TDD:
- Improved code quality
- Better code design and architecture
- Faster debugging
- Built-in regression testing

## 4. Unit Testing in JavaScript and Python 🧩

### 4.1 JavaScript Unit Testing with Jest

Jest is a popular testing framework for JavaScript projects.

#### Example Jest Test:

```javascript
// sum.js
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
module.exports = sum;

// sum.test.js
const sum = require('./sum');

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

### 4.2 Python Unit Testing with PyTest

PyTest is a robust testing framework for Python.

#### Example PyTest:

```python
# test_sum.py
def sum(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_sum():
    assert sum(1, 2) == 3
```

## 5. Integration Testing 🔗

Integration testing verifies that different modules or services work well together.

### 5.1 Approaches to Integration Testing:
- **Big Bang**: Integrate all modules at once
- **Incremental**: Integrate and test modules one by one
- **Sandwich**: Combine top-down and bottom-up approaches

### 5.2 Example: API Integration Test with Supertest (Node.js)

```javascript
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('../app');

describe('GET /users', function() {
  it('responds with json containing a list of users', function(done) {
    request(app)
      .get('/users')
      .set('Accept', 'application/json')
      .expect('Content-Type', /json/)
      .expect(200, done);
  });
});
```

## 6. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) 🎭

BDD is an extension of TDD that emphasizes collaboration between developers, QA, and non-technical stakeholders.

### 6.1 BDD Frameworks:
- Cucumber (Multi-language)
- Jasmine (JavaScript)
- Behave (Python)

### 6.2 Example: Cucumber Feature File

```gherkin
Feature: User Login
  Scenario: Successful login
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter valid credentials
    And I click the login button
    Then I should be redirected to the dashboard
```

## 7. Mocking and Stubbing 🎭

Mocking and stubbing are techniques used in unit testing to isolate the code being tested.

### 7.1 Mocking with Jest

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');
jest.mock('axios');

test('should fetch users', () => {
  const users = [{name: 'Bob'}];
  const resp = {data: users};
  axios.get.mockResolvedValue(resp);

  return getUsers().then(data => expect(data).toEqual(users));
});
```

### 7.2 Mocking with Python's unittest.mock

```python
from unittest.mock import patch
import mymodule

@patch('mymodule.requests.get')
def test_get_users(mock_get):
    mock_get.return_value.json.return_value = {'users': [{'name': 'Bob'}]}
    result = mymodule.get_users()
    assert result == [{'name': 'Bob'}]
```

## 8. Code Coverage 📊

Code coverage is a metric that measures the amount of code executed during your tests.

### 8.1 Types of Code Coverage:
- **Statement Coverage**: Percentage of statements executed
- **Branch Coverage**: Percentage of branches executed
- **Function Coverage**: Percentage of functions called
- **Line Coverage**: Percentage of lines executed

### 8.2 Code Coverage Tools:
- **Istanbul**: For JavaScript projects
- **Coverage.py**: For Python projects

### 8.3 Example: Istanbul Configuration in package.json

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "coverage": "jest --coverage"
  },
  "jest": {
    "collectCoverage": true,
    "coverageReporters": ["text", "lcov"],
    "coverageThreshold": {
      "global": {
        "branches": 80,
        "functions": 80,
        "lines": 80,
        "statements": 80
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 9. Continuous Integration and Continuous Testing ⚙️

CI/CD pipelines often include automated testing to ensure code quality before deployment.

### 9.1 Example: GitHub Actions Workflow for Testing

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14.x'
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm test
    - run: npm run coverage
    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1
```

## 10. Performance Testing 🚀

Performance testing ensures that software applications can handle expected loads and respond within acceptable time frames.

### 10.1 Types of Performance Tests:
- **Load Testing**: Testing behavior under normal and peak loads
- **Stress Testing**: Testing behavior under extreme loads
- **Scalability Testing**: Testing how system scales with increasing load
- **Endurance Testing**: Testing system behavior over extended periods

### 10.2 Performance Testing Tools:
- **Apache JMeter**: Open-source load testing tool
- **Gatling**: Scala-based load testing tool
- **Locust**: Python-based load testing tool

### 10.3 Example: Simple Locust Test

```python
from locust import HttpUser, task, between

class WebsiteUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 5)

    @task
    def index_page(self):
        self.client.get("/")

    @task(3)
    def view_item(self):
        item_id = random.randint(1, 10000)
        self.client.get(f"/item?id={item_id}", name="/item")
```

## 11. Security Testing 🔒

Security testing identifies vulnerabilities in software applications that could be exploited by malicious actors.

### 11.1 Types of Security Tests:
- Vulnerability Scanning
- Penetration Testing
- Security Auditing
- Risk Assessment

### 11.2 Security Testing Tools:
- **OWASP ZAP**: Open-source security testing tool
- **Metasploit**: Penetration testing framework
- **Nmap**: Network discovery and security auditing

## 12. Best Practices in Testing 🌟

1. **Write Tests Early**: Embrace test-driven development
2. **Keep Tests Simple**: Each test should focus on one specific behavior
3. **Use Descriptive Test Names**: Clear names help in understanding test purpose
4. **Maintain Test Independence**: Tests should not depend on each other
5. **Avoid Test Duplication**: DRY principle applies to tests too
6. **Regular Test Maintenance**: Keep tests up-to-date with code changes
7. **Continuous Integration**: Run tests automatically on every code change
8. **Monitor Test Performance**: Slow tests can hinder development speed
9. **Use Test Doubles Judiciously**: Overuse of mocks can lead to brittle tests
10. **Code Coverage is Not Everything**: High coverage doesn't guarantee quality

## 13. Practical Exercise: Comprehensive Testing Setup 🛠️
